Hey there!
  I created this website ( https://uditmore.me ) as a personal portfolio.
  This is my first webpage ever created and learned things like HTML, CSS and (not JavaScript) Patience!
  This webpage will update as soon as I learn something new.
  I'm open for suggestions and ideas always!
  Happy CODING!
